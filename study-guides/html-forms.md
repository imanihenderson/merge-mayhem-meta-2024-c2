# HTML Forms
<<<<<<< HEAD
**Note:** The `form` element itself sets up an area to collect user input but does nothing with the information. This is where JavaScript steps in to process the data and make appropriate actions. This is why it is important to give each element an `id`, `name`, and/or `class`.
=======

The [HTML `form` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) represents a section of interactive controls for submitting information.

There are many different types of information you may want to collect from users, text-based answers, numbers, files, checkboxes, date, email, etc. It is important to specify the type of information you are collecting to make it easier for the computer to parse or translate the information and determine next actions.


To collect all of this information, we use the `input` element and specify the type of information by using the `type` attribute.

Letâ€™s take a look at a few examples of how the `input` element is used for a variety of types of information.
